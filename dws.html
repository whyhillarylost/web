      <h2>Hillary Clinton Statement on the Resignation of Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz</h2>
	  <p><i>Following today’s resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz from her role as Chair of the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:</i></p>
	  <p>“I want to thank my longtime friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the Democratic National Committee over the past five years. I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year’s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week’s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership. There’s simply no one better at taking the fight to the Republicans than Debbie–which is why I am glad that she has agreed to serve as honorary chair of my campaign’s 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country, and will continue to serve as a surrogate for my campaign nationally, in Florida, and in other key states. I look forward to campaigning with Debbie in Florida and helping her in her re-election bid–because as President, I will need fighters like Debbie in Congress who are ready on day one to get to work for the American people.”</p>
