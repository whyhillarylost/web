	    <p>Sometime soon I am going to suggest that Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and Bill de Blasio create the equivalent of a People's PAC to raise huge amounts of money from small donors---after the convention---to support electing liberals at all levels....including but far beyond Hillary assuming she is nominated..... </p>
	    <p><em>Beyond this Hillary should stop attacking Bernie, especially when she says things that are untrue, which candidly she often does.</em> I am one of the people with credibility to suggest Bernie people support her in November, and she and Benenson and others have <em>no idea of the damage she does to herself with these attacks, which she does not gain by making.</em> </p>
	    <p>Instead the smart move would be to look for issues where she can dovetail with Bernie. One I am definitely going to suggest would be to take his proposal for a free public college education paid for by a transaction tax on Wall Street speculation and add one new dimension....that to receive this benefit young people should devote one year to some form of community or public service.... There is no reason Hillary cannot not support this.... </p>
	    <p><em>Right now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump....she has huge endemic political weaknesses that she would be wise to rectify.....even a clown like Ted Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me</em>..... </p>
