      <p>Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.</p>
	  <p>Folks, I did a service project today. It's so tragic. And what's worse, some homes have not been tested and it's important to encourage seniors to also get tested.</p>

            <p>DEATH
              PENALTY</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>19 states
              and the District of Columbia have banned the death
              penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the
              death penalty. According to the National Coalition to
              Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have
              been on death row and later set free. Since 1976,
              1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11%
              of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later
              exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other
              states join the current list and abolish the death
              penalty?</p>

      <p>UNIONS</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Secretary Clinton, yesterday in St. Louis, you spoke
        at carpenters and others “who built this nation.” Both you and
        Senator Sanders depend on big union support. President Obama
        pushed for a massive infrastructure bill that would mean
        millions of jobs for in this area. Yet many of these trade
        unions have locked out Blacks and other minorities for years.
        Will you call a meeting with them before November, and if you
        win, when you are president, to demand that the trade unions
        stop freezing Blacks and others from these good paying jobs?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>INCOME INEQUALITY</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Senators Sanders, you and Hillary Clinton have often
        talked about the problem of income inequality. Many other
        Democrats have. Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. has talked about the
        lack of economic upward mobility for Black and other
        minorities in Silicon Valley and corporate America. Yet Power
        Pac Plus did a study showing that four years ago, the
        Democratic Party spent $514 million on consultants, and only
        1.7%, or $8.4 million went to minority-owned firms or firms
        with at least one minority principle. How can the public be
        assured that either one of you or the Democratic Party can fix
        income inequality when the same party practices it?</p>
