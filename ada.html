        <p><em>"Ada is a complex computer algorithm that the campaign was prepared to publicly unveil after the election as its invisible guiding hand.</em> Named for a female 19th-century mathematician — Ada, Countess of Lovelace — the <em>algorithm was said to play a role in virtually every strategic decision Clinton aides made, including where and when to deploy the candidate</em> and her battalion of surrogates and where to air television ads — as well as when it was safe to stay dark.</p>
        <p>While the Clinton campaign's reliance on analytics became well known, the particulars of Ada's work were kept under tight wraps, according to aides. The algorithm operated on a separate computer server than the rest of the Clinton operation as a security precaution, and only a few senior aides were able to access it.</p> 
        <p>According to aides, a raft of polling numbers, public and private, were fed into the algorithm, as well as ground-level voter data meticulously collected by the campaign. Once early voting began, those numbers were factored in, too.</p>
        <p>What Ada did, based on all that data, aides said, was <em>run 400,000 simulations a day of what the race against Trump might look like. A report that was spit out would give campaign manager Robby Mook and others a detailed picture of which battleground states were most likely to tip the race</em> in one direction or another — and guide decisions about where to spend time and deploy resources.</p>
        <p>About some things, she was apparently right. Aides say Pennsylvania was pegged as an extremely important state early on, which explains why Clinton was such a frequent visitor and chose to hold her penultimate rally in Philadelphia on Monday night.</p>
        <p>But it appears that <em>the importance of other states Clinton would lose — including Michigan and Wisconsin — never became fully apparent</em> or that it was too late once it did."</p>
        <p>Clinton made several visits to Michigan during the general election, but it wasn't until the final days that she, Obama and her husband made such a concerted effort.</p>
        <p><em>As for Wisconsin: Clinton didn't make any appearances there at all.</em></p>
        <p>Like much of the political establishment Ada appeared to underestimate the power of rural voters in Rust Belt states.</p>
        <p>Clearly, there were things neither she nor a human could foresee — like a pair of bombshell letters sent by the FBI about Clinton's email server. But in coming days and weeks, expect a debate on how heavily campaigns should rely on data, particularly in a year like this one in which so many conventional rules of politics were cast aside.</p>
