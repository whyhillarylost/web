	  <p>I just talked to the Gov and his Political Dir.   He called Bernie a few hours ago and said he's endorsing you, Madame Secretary.  It will be public at 3:30 today.<br />
	  This was a bold move for him so it would be great if you can call and say thanks.<br />
	  Apparently Jane Sanders has now called him twice and begged him to change his mind and he's stood firm.<br />
	  Huma, I will send contact info asap.</p>
