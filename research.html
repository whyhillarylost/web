      <p>"First, there are the <em>direct contributions from people working for fossil fuel companies</em> to Clinton’s campaign committee. According to the most recent filings, <em>the committee has received $309,101 (as of April 11, 2016;</em> source: Center for Responsive Politics for oil and gas and coal) from such donors.</p>
      <p>Next are the <em>fossil fuel lobbyists</em>, many of whom have also bundled contributions. These donations also flow to Clinton’s campaign committee. Greenpeace has tracked <em>$2,650,580 in bundled and direct donations from lobbyists currently registered as lobbying for the fossil fuel industry.</em></p>
      <p>Last are <em>contributions from fossil fuel interests to Super PACs</em> supporting Hillary Clinton. Greenpeace has found <em>$4,000,000 in donations from large donors connected to the fossil fuel industry to Priorities Action USA</em>, a Super PAC supporting Secretary Clinton’s campaign.</p>
      <p><em>All told, the campaign to elect Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 has received more than $6.9 million from lobbyists, bundlers, and large donors connected to the fossil fuel industry.</em>"</p>
