	  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt [Bill's affiar with Monica Lewinsky] was a lapse, but she [Hillary] says to his credit he tried to break it off, tried to pull away, tried to manage someone who was clearly a "narcissistic loony toon"; but it was beyond control. And, HRC insists, no matter what people say, it was gross inappropriate behavior but it was consensual (was not a power relationship) and was not sex within any real meaning (standup, liedown, oral, etc.) of the term.<br />

	  Dec. 3 - discuss books, movies, packwood (HC tired of all those whiney women, and she needs him on health care). I told her I'd been bonding w. creeps; she said that was the story of her whole past year. Fabio incident - sweeping her up, sending roses. Call from BC on road; very very affectionate<br />
